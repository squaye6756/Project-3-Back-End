# Project-3-Back-End

https://streetball-back.herokuapp.com/

This is the back-end server for the StreetBall heroku app (https://streetball-front.herokuapp.com/).

It uses Express and Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB Atlas database.

There are four routes: Index, Create, Delete and Edit. 

There are two models used -- teams and players --however the latter model did not get used in the app's final build.
